# LectureParty
Tired of watching pre-recorded online lectures on your own? You're not alone. Students all over the world are struggling to adjust to asynchronous learning this year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. It requires a lot of self-discipline to watch lectures by yourself, especially without your classmates and real-time interaction to motivate you.

LectureParty offers a way for you to watch lectures with your classmates! Not only can you video call and get to know each other while preparing for class, you can also chat and take notes together.
